======

In Unix-like OS, this projects can chatting and sending file between two host. Because it's not easy to across different NAT. My solution is to use a another host which has a public address to forwarding the message. <br \>

======

1. Put the server code in server host, if you want test and doesn't have a server hos, you can contact me and use my server
2. Start client
3. Register the server address
    register format:
    [register] myname oppositeName
    for example:
    A register: [register] A B
    B regisger: [register] B A
4. It can chatting directly
5. If you want to send file, use format: [file] filename <br \>
6. Use [quit] to quit
